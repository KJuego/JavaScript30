# Array Cardio Day 1 Challenge | KJuego

## What does it do?
    Unlike the other challenges, this program is designed to do several different tasks using array methods. For example, how to sort all of the names in an array.

## What I've Learned
- How to Use Array Methods (filter(), map(), sort(), and reduce())
- How to Convert NodeLists into Arrays (Using Array.from() or [...])
- To Never Forget a return Statement Again

## Accomplishments I'm Proud Of
- For Learning A Lot in a Short Time Frame
- For Applying Skills Learned in an Earlier Challenge
- For Being Able to Do Parts of the Challenges Without Watching the Video :)
