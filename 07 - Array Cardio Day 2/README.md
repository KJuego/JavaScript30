# Array Cardio Day 2 Challenge | KJuego

## What does it do?
    Similar to the Array Cardio Day 1 challenge, this program is designed to do several different tasks using array methods. For example, how to find a specific element in an array.

## What I've Learned
- How to Find Out if At Least One or All Elements Meet a Specific Requirement Using some() and every()
- How to Find/Remove Items from an Array using find(), findIndex(), splice() and slice()

## Accomplishments I'm Proud Of
- For Learning A Lot in a Short Time Frame
- For Applying Skills Learned in an Earlier Challenge
- For Taking the Time to Read Documentation on 'developer.mozilla.org'
- For Completing the Entire Challenge Without Watching the Video :D
