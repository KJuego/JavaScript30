# Flex Panel Gallery Challenge | KJuego

## What does it do?
    This is an image gallery, consisting of five images and five phrases. By default, each panel displays part of an image and a single word from its phrase.

    If the user clicks on a panel, the panel widens to show the entire image and the whole phrase. If the user clicks on the same panel again, the panel reverts to its initial size. Users may click on more than one panel at a time.

## How can you use it?
1. Download all of the files in this folder (05 - Flex Panel Gallery).
2. Open the index-KJuego.html file (or the index-WesBos.html) in a browser.
3. Click on any panel(s) you want and see the changes for yourself!
